```python
@dataclass
class HealthReport:
    report_id: int
    similarity_score: int
    similarity_label: str
    underrepresented_species: List[str]
    health_score: float
    interpretation: str
```

## Quick Start Guide

```python
import dspy
from health_agent import HealthAgent, HealthReport

# Initialize the health analysis agent
agent = HealthAgent()

# Create a sample health report
report = HealthReport(
    report_id=12345,
    similarity_score=75,
    similarity_label="Good",
    underrepresented_species=["Bifidobacterium", "Lactobacillus"],
    health_score=8.2,
    interpretation="Your microbiome shows good diversity..."
)

# Generate analysis and recommendations
summary = agent.forward(report, "Can you summarize my health report?")
recommendations = agent.forward(report, "What dietary recommendations do you have?")
risk_analysis = agent.forward(report, "What are my health risks?")
```

## Supported Query Types

The agent intelligently classifies and responds to various categories of health-related questions:

### Summary and Overview Queries
- "Summarize my health report"
- "What are the key takeaways?"
- "Provide an overview of my results"
- "What are the top three insights?"

### Microbiome Species Analysis
- "Which bacteria are underrepresented?"
- "What specific microbes should I boost?"
- "Analyze my bacterial composition"
- "Tell me about missing bacteria"

### Risk Assessment Queries
- "What are my health risks?"
- "What health implications should I be aware of?"
- "Are there concerning patterns in my data?"
- "What does this mean for my health?"

### Recommendation Requests
- "What dietary changes should I make?"
- "Do you recommend any supplements?"
- "How can I improve my microbiome health?"
- "What lifestyle modifications are suggested?"

### Score Interpretation
- "Explain my health score"
- "What does my similarity score mean?"
- "Interpret these numerical values"
- "What is my similarity label?"

## System Architecture

The agent employs a modular DSPy architecture with specialized components for different analysis tasks:

```
HealthAgent/
├── signatures/
│   ├── Report_Summarizer         # Generates comprehensive summaries
│   ├── Species_Analyzer          # Analyzes bacterial species data
│   ├── Risk_Analyzer            # Assesses health risks
│   ├── Recommendation_Generator  # Creates personalized recommendations
│   ├── Question_Valid           # Validates query relevance
│   ├── Health_Score             # Interprets health scores
│   └── Similarity_Score_Info    # Analyzes similarity metrics
├── validation/                  # Query validation logic
├── classification/              # Question categorization system
└── training_data/              # Contextual examples and patterns
```

## Validation Framework

The agent implements a comprehensive validation system to ensure query relevance and maintain response quality:

### Accepted Query Categories
- Similarity scores and label interpretation
- Health score analysis and implications
- Underrepresented species identification and analysis
- Risk assessment based on microbiome data
- Evidence-based dietary and lifestyle recommendations
- Supplement suggestions related to microbiome health
- Retesting frequency and monitoring advice

### Rejected Query Categories
- General health advice unrelated to microbiome reports
- Medical diagnosis or treatment recommendations
- Personal or family medical history inquiries
- Unrelated laboratory tests or medication advice
- General wellness topics outside microbiome scope

## Usage Examples

### Comprehensive Report Analysis
```python
question = "What are the most important findings from my microbiome analysis?"
response = agent.forward(report, question)
# Returns detailed summary focusing on key health indicators
```

### Targeted Species Recommendations
```python
question = "Which specific bacteria should I focus on improving?"
response = agent.forward(report, question)
# Provides targeted recommendations for underrepresented species
```

### Risk Profile Assessment
```python
question = "Based on my results, what health risks should I monitor?"
response = agent.forward(report, question)
# Delivers evidence-based risk assessment with actionable insights
```

## Configuration and Customization

### Training Data Requirements
The agent requires properly structured training datasets:
- `reports.json`: Sample health reports for contextual reference
- `questioner.json`: Question-answer pairs for response training

### Question Pattern Configuration
```python
question_patterns = {
    'summary': ['summary', 'summarize', 'brief', 'overview', 'takeaway'],
    'species': ['microbe', 'species', 'bacteria', 'underrepresented', 'boost'],
    'risk': ['risk', 'implications', 'diseases', 'condition', 'health implications'],
    'recommendations': ['recommendations', 'diet', 'supplement', 'lifestyle', 'advice']
}
```

## Testing and Validation

Comprehensive testing capabilities are built into the system:

```python
# Validate query relevance
is_valid, validation_message = agent.validate("What supplements should I consider?", report)

# Test question classification
question_category = agent.classify("Tell me about my bacterial diversity")

# Execute complete analysis pipeline
response = agent.forward(report, "How frequently should I retest my microbiome?")
```

## Extending the Agent

### Adding New Analysis Modules

1. Define a new DSPy signature:
```python
class CustomAnalysis(dspy.Signature):
    """Custom analysis signature for specialized health insights"""
    input_data = dspy.InputField(desc="Input data description")
    analysis_result = dspy.OutputField(desc="Analysis output description")
```

2. Integrate into the HealthAgent architecture:
```python
self.custom_analyzer = dspy.ChainOfThought(CustomAnalysis)
```

3. Update classification patterns and validation rules accordingly

### Custom Validation Implementation
```python
def implement_custom_validation(self, question: str, report: HealthReport) -> tuple[bool, str]:
    """
    Implement domain-specific validation logic
    Returns validation status and explanatory message
    """
    # Custom validation implementation
    return validation_result, explanation
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Response Time**: Optimized for real-time health report analysis
- **Accuracy**: Leverages context-aware training data for consistent responses
- **Scalability**: Modular architecture supports easy feature expansion
- **Reliability**: Comprehensive validation ensures relevant, accurate responses
